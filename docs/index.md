# Open data on oil, gas, and mining payments
##  Extractive Sector Transparency Measures Act (ESTMA)

The **[Extractive Sector Transparency Measures Act (ESTMA)](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/E-22.7/page-1.html)** helps the Government of Canada deter corruption in the extractive sector. Extractive entities — oil, gas, and mining businesses — that are active in Canada must publicly disclose certain types of payments made to governments in Canada and abroad. 
Visit **[Natural Resources Canada's website](https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/our-natural-resources/minerals-mining/extractive-sector-transparency-measures-act/18180)** to learn more about the ESTMA.
